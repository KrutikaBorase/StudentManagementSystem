# StudentManagementSystem
The College Database Management System is a comprehensive SQL-based solution designed to manage and organize essential data related to a collegeâ€™s operations. This system maintains detailed records of students, faculty, courses, departments, and enrollments, reflecting the real-world relationships between these entities.

The database structure uses normalization techniques to avoid data redundancy and ensures data integrity through primary and foreign key constraints. It supports common operations such as adding new students and faculty, assigning courses to departments, enrolling students in courses, and updating grades or schedules.

Advanced SQL queries enable generating meaningful reports like student enrollment lists, faculty course assignments, departmental course offerings, and academic performance summaries. This project demonstrates practical skills in database design, relational modeling, complex query writing, and efficient data management suitable for academic institutions.
